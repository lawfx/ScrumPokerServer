A server for hosting scrum poker games

This is a project we are developing together with [MarekJAM](https://github.com/MarekJAM) mainly for learning purposes. I am developing the back-end and he is working on the front-end part. You can find his client repo here https://github.com/MarekJAM/scrum_poker_app
